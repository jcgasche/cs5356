Automated News Platform
--------

### Background
Getting news out fast across a network has become, arguably, the most important thing for publishers. I want to explore a way to identify news, turn it into proprietary content, and then get that content out across platforms faster than ever before. 

### Challenge
I want to try to build something that ingests breaking news automatically, probably by tapping into one or many APIs. Once that content is ingested, I want to attempt to synthesize it, process it, and make it our own by using a bounteous cornucopia of NLP and machine learning tools (likely supplemented by pseudo-crowdsourced human labor). Lastly, I will try to ship it out quickly across networks where people read their news nowadays (Facebook, Twitter).
